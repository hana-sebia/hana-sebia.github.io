      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Ph.D. candidate at the French national research institute Inria. My research focuses on machine learning for healthcare data, combining structured clinical data and medical imaging. I work on temporal phenotyping for high-dimensional electronic health records (EHR) using tensor factorization methods, as well as for medical image analysis. In addition, I develop deep learning models for vascular segmentation, modality transfer, and super-resolution in functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging. My goal is to design interpretable and efficient models that support data-driven discovery and decision-making in both clinical and preclinical settings.
